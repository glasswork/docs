Gantry Prime is a standalone Gantry 5 installation which allows developers and testers to access all the features in both the  administration area and the site frontend without the overhead and quirks of installing and running a CMS.

The platform consists of static pages, modules and common assets as well as the default configuration and layouts to display those. Themes can then be installed to this platform allowing you to run through all the predefined content, thus making it an ideal development and testing platform. New sample content can be included by just adding the files, so whenever there is a new issue, you can just include a new test case and make sure that past and future templates will not have the same issue.

In the future, Gantry Prime could also be used to showcase themes and their administration making it appropriate for use as a demo environment. Think of having a demo where users could freely play around in the theme administration and see their changes in the theme itself. These changes could be session based, allowing many users to play with the environment without messing up anything else but their own instance.
